# This was written to make a list for synonyms from a pdf which had the correct answers on the opposite side of the pdf 
#  XQ   yQ  -- on page1
#  yA   XA  -- on page2
# I copied the entire pdf contents to a list and made a file first , this had 240 lines in it. 
# As I had to deal with a bloack of 10 I did the following up to 240
# sed -n '1,10p' syn2 > a
# sed -n '11,20p' syn2 > b
# sed -n '21,30p' syn2 > c
# sed -n '31,40p' syn2 > d

# Then I split each block into 2 set so that I could pick the answers
# for XX in {a..x}; do  sed -n '1,5p' $XX > ${XX}_1; sed -n '6,10p' $XX > ${XX}_2; done

# Then the following was run to extract 


for XX in a b
 do  
for line in {1..5}
 do 
W1=`sed "${line}q;d" ${XX}_1|awk '{print $1}'`
W2=`sed "${line}q;d" ${XX}_1|awk '{print $2}'`
W3=`sed "${line}q;d" ${XX}_2|awk '{print $1}'`
W4=`sed "${line}q;d" ${XX}_2|awk '{print $2}'`
 echo "$W1  $W4"
 echo "$W2  $W3"
